# 👋 Welcome to Ahrefs-Continue

## ❗️ Before you get started

Ahrefs-Continue is currently in the left sidebar, but we recommend moving it to the right. This way it won't cover your file explorer. You can move it back at any time.

For autocompletion, it should work out of the box. If it doesn't, raise the issue in #dev-copilot
